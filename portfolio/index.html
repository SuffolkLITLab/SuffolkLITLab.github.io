	<h2>Our Spring 2018 Portfolio</h2>

		The following is a tenative list (we're still growing it) of projects slated for the spring 2018 semester. If you'd like to check on their progress and talk to the team in-person, consider attending the April 9, 2018 <a href="../events/#clinnovation">Clinnovation conference</a>.

		<p>When a juvenile is facing delinquency charges, courts often order youth to locate and participate in community programs as a condition of probation.  Their ability to find and successfully participate in these programs can have long-lasting impacts on their sentences - and their futures. A constellation of social services exists for youths. These services, however, are offered by a variety of agencies, public and private, and make use of differing eligibility requirements. Additionally, access to such services is often dependent on physical proximity. Consequently, service discovery is a time-intensive process, and exhaustive exploration of services by youth and youth advocates is often impractical. For this reason, the lab is working on the creation of a tool that will allow users to filter service providers by location, age, and service type. Current thinking is focused on the creation of a map-based tool that allows users to search for and find relevant service providers as one might look for a restaurant an Yelp. Initially, this web application (website optimized to look good on a phone) will concern itself with service providers in the Boston metro area. However, the technology being used would allow for the expansion of this application to include expansion into more service types and areas. This will include documentation to help others create their own instances of the app. </p>

		<p class="profile_title"><a name="bizent" href="#bizent" class="anchor"></a>Business Entity Formation Information Bot</p>
		<p>"Suffolk Law School’s Intellectual Property &amp; Entrepreneurship Clinic (IPEC) provides free legal services to appropriate clients with limited resources on issues relating to new and emerging businesses, with a focus on intellectual property (copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets)." A large volume of their initial interactions is spent educating potential clients on the options available to them, specifically relating the forms of businesses available. Consequently, the clinic would like a tool to help offload some of this to an automated system. This is currently envisioned to take the form of a guided interview (chatbot) that would ask users to answer a number of questions and order the information they see. These interviews would end with a set of action items that the user could act on prior to a first meeting (e.g., Looks like we’ll be talking about LLC vs. partnership. You should come in with the following documents...). Additionally, the system can act as a triage tool helping to identify those potential clients most in need of the clinic’s assistance.

		<p class="profile_title"><a name="gservice" href="#gservice" class="anchor"></a>Generalized Service Eligibility Finder</p>
		<p>There are a constellation of social services available to low- and moderate- income individuals and families in Massachusetts. These services range from food stamps, to fuel assistance, to free transportation.  These services are offered by a variety of agencies, public and private, and make use of differing eligibility requirements.  Consequently, service discovery is a decentralized and time-intensive process, and most people never avail themselves of the full spectrum of services to which they may be entitled. As such, an exhaustive exploration of services by potentially eligible parties and their advocates is often impractical. Unlike the youth service finder tool, this tool will focus on surfacing relevant services for low- to moderate-income individuals with moderately complex eligibility requirements (e.g., multiple interacting criteria and levels of service such as TANF). That is, unlike the youth service finder, which acted like a directory for service providers, this tool is focused more on finding specific programs tailored to a person’s eligibility and needs. This will be accomplished by first eliciting replies to a series of guided interview questions - all geared toward identifying client need. These replies will be taken as inputs and used to determine the likelihood that one would see a benefit from a given program based on a set of predefined rules and machine learning algorithms. A set of services will then be presented and explored based on an attempt to prioritize those with the highest potential benefit for a given person seeking services.</p>
