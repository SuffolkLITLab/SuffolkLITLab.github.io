    <p><b>April 8, 2019.</b> The upcoming LIT Con conference in Boston will highlight work in legal innovation and technology (LIT). If you would like to present a rapid-fire talk (LIT Bit), please reply to this <a href="http://suffolklitlab.org/LITCon/2019/litbits">open call</a>. If you are unfamiliar with rapid-fire talks, they are are a presentation format in which speakers prepare a set number of slides which advance automatically at regular intervals to produce a short energetic presentation of definite length. See e.g., Ignite Talks and PechaKucha. If your submission is chosen, you will be asked to put together a presentation with 20 slides where each slide stays visible for 15 seconds (making for a 5 min long presentation).</p>

		<p><b>November 17-18, 2018.</b>
      Join the Tubman Project and Suffolk's LIT Lab on November 17th and 18th to help create open source tools for public defenders. We'll have three challenges and $3,000 for the teams that can conquer them.
    </p><p>
      There are no size requirements for teams and no need to form a team prior to the event. So you can work on your own or join up with folks when you arrive.
    </p><p>
      You'll receive a full set of constraints at the event, but for the most part we're platform agnostic. Solutions must, however, be open sourced and of use to public defenders. That means they have to be able to use them. Here's a brief outline of the three challenges, build: (1) a tool to automate review of video; (2) a secure encrypted survey, think signal + google forms; and (3) a "backup my alibi" tool that collects third-party contemporaneous records to bolster ones alibi, think social media posts with geolocation info.
    </p><p>
      We're looking for developers and attorneys since legal considerations will be just as important as technical ones. More to the point, they'll often be intertwined. For example, is there a possibility that communications across an encrypted channel may be subject to discovery? How do you assure that the alibi tool doesn't get misused as a secret tracker?

		<p class="profile_title"><a name="c4l" href="#c4l" class="anchor" alt="deep link to this section"></a>Coding for Lawyers (C4L) Summit</p>
		<p><b>April 10, 2018.</b> A number of law schools have begun to offer "coding for lawyers" (or CS for lawyers) courses to students. This invite-only summit will convene C4L professors/instructors to explore the purposes, methods, and future of these courses, with an overarching goal of being descriptive, rather than prescriptive. Specifically, rather than ask "should lawyers learn to code?," this summit will ask why instructors are teaching lawyers and law students how to code, and the pros/cons of various approaches. The first summit will be hosted at the <a href="https://suffolklitlab.github.io/">Suffolk Legal Innovation and Technology Lab</a> directly following Suffolk's <a href="https://suffolklitlab.github.io/clinnovation/">Clinnovation conference</a>. The output of the summit will include: (1) a survey of programs; (2) a path forward with working groups; and (3) next steps for future summits (to be held each six months with a traveling component). Over time, our intent is for the community of instructors to grow and to produce free, open-source resources for schools around the world to teach coding for lawyers.</p>
