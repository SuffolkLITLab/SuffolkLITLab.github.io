	<h2>How To...</h2>
  <div class="r_img_embed" style="max-width:550px;">
    <img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tech_support_cheat_sheet.png" title="'Hey Megan, it's your father. How do I print out a flowchart?'" alt="Tech Support Cheat Sheet" width="100%"/>
    <div class="caption">Image and Hover Text: <a href="https://xkcd.com/627/" class="captionlnk">Tech Support Cheat Sheet</a> by XKCD</div>
  </div>
	<p>
	   This XKCD comic is a pretty good primer on "learning" your way around new software. However, we saw a benefit in providing more formal materials, hence LIT HOW-TO. The following documentation is used to help bring lab members up to speed on a constellation of tech tools and concepts used in our work. They're a work in progress, but we hope even in their current state others might find them useful too. So please, poke around.
   </p>
   <p>
     One could start at the beginning and work their way through all of the "lessons," however, it's more common for us to reference sections as projects call for them. That being said, the first section is a good place to start. We plan to use these resources heavily in next Fall's <a href="../courses/#2998">Coding the Law</a> and as a supplement for <a href="../courses/#fellows">LIT Fellows</a> and students in the <a href="../courses/#2418">LIT Lab</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Self-direction is the name of the game. However, students, and to a lessor extent the general public, are not playing without a net. All are welcome to join the Lab's <a href="../slack/">Slack Team</a>. There you'll find public channels for most of the sections below. We hope you'll use them to ask and answer questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Lab's standing rule re. asking for help is as follows: <i>If you set to doing something and you are hitting your head against a wall for 30 plus minutes, ask for help in the appropriate Slack channel</i>.</p>
    <p>
      If you're not a Lab student and you are using one of the channels associated with a section below, you must abide by the following three rules:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>You've got to be kind;<sup>&dagger;</sup></li>
        <li>If you're asking a question, don't expect an immediate answer (remember Rule 1);</li>
        <li>If you're answering a question (which you're encouraged to do), don't provide an answer out of the gate. Work to point people in the right direction; and</li>
        <li>Fill out your user profile so we know who you are.</li>
	    </ol>
  <p>
    <sup>&dagger;</sup> Lab faculty are ultimate arbiters for all disputes.
  </p>

      We use a number of software tools to help us collaborate. To help us hit the ground running, we ask that you sign up for a few free services and download some free software.
    </p>
    <p>
      As discussed above, we have a <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> team. If you're a member of the Lab, you need to sign up for an account and <a href="../slack/">join our team</a>. Once you have, <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile">fill out your profile</a>, and <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212281468-Direct-messages-and-group-DMs">DM</a> @Colarusso, asking him to add you to your class's private channel. Anyone can <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239967-Browse-and-join-channels">join public channels</a>. Slack is the Lab's primary communication channel. Consequently, students are expected to regularly check Slack or to set up push notifications. You can download <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201746897-Slack-apps-for-computers-phones-tablets">the app</a> for your phone or desktop.
    </p>
    <p> Remember the standing rule re. asking for help: <i>If you set to doing something and you are hitting your head against a wall for 30 plus minutes, ask for help in the appropriate Slack channel</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To stay on top of projects, we make use of a tool called <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>. If you don't have an account, you can <a href="https://trello.com/signup">create one here</a>.<sup>&dagger;</sup>
      Students (<b>and anyone interested in taking our self tests</b>) will need a Google Account. If you don't have one, you can <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp">create one here</a>.<sup>&dagger;</sup>

      You need a tool to read and write code, and no, Microsoft Word won't do the trick. You need a text editor. Unlike word processors, they don't touch anything but text. Have you ever tryied to cut and paste something from Word only to have the formating all messed up? That's because there's a bunch of unseen stuff mixed in with your text. This works well for letters but no so much for code. Also, most text editors will highlight your code, making it easier to read. Some popular free text editors include <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepadd++</a> (Windows only), and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. If you don't have a text editor, download one from the preceeding list. It will come in handy soon.
    </p>


    <p>
      <sup>&dagger;</sup> If you're a member of the lab, you should create a new "work" account to avoid intermingling personal and work accounts. Keep in mind that your usernames may be used publicly in Lab materials available on the Web and associated with your work. Choose them accordingly.

		<p>Git is a system for managing the many versions of code one writes over the course of a coding project. At one level, it can act like track changes for computer code, allowing multiple people to collaborate on a single project. GitHub is a website on which you can host and manage projects using Git. It's also a community of users where people share their code. The following short lessons will walk you through setting up a GitHub account and how to make use of GitHub pages to publish a simple website.</p>

		<p>Most of the time when you interact with a "chatbot," you're interacting with a glorified decision tree. QnA is a markup language for people with little or no programming experience. Designed with attorneys in mind, it transforms blocks of text into interactive question and answer sessions (QnA interviews). Such rules-based systems are sometimes called expert systems, and the idea is that one can encode some small area of knowledge as part of an interactive decision tree, making it more broadly available. In the following lessons you will learn how to turn flowcharts into functioning QnA interviews/"chatbots."</p>
